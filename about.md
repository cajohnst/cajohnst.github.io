I am an analyst, philosopher, and writer focused on deciphering moral ecologies, then molding new ones—first, for the individual finding their footing within greater systems: within themselves, within their communities, within the world, and secondly, in order to consider the philosophical grounds for a shift in our moral impetus from individual freedom to collective ecological responsibility. This shift will be necessary in designing a sustainable future for human beings.

I am an investor and part-time trader. I write to empower the individual investor, that they might understand the reality of investing, and sharpen their mindset with principles of risk and awareness of psychological difficulties common in trading. While investing in profit-driven corporations may present a moral quandary, the principle of investing, as insurance against one’s individual economic risk, is applicable and beneficial for all who can participate. The barriers to entry have never been lower to retail investors than now.
