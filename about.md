I am a software developer turned digital nomad who is passionate about personal development, finance, minimalism, and acquiring and sharing knowledge freely.
Growing up in North Carolina, I developed a special appreciation for the outdoors which has transmuted into frequent jaunts down the open road and open trail.
I am hoping to share some of my doubtless work-in-progress hobbies here: my up and coming culinary skills, digital photography, various writing forms, (***bad***) attempts at being funny, my steadily growing digital bookshelf, and fiddling with stringed instruments.
There is a good chance I am spreading myself too thin here. Carter... do less!
I do not purport to know much, but I would like to know a little about everything. And ***that*** is on life long learning!
I hope through this blog you might find some tidbit of value, perhaps an interesting interpretation of the world that I have found to be useful in my own journey. That bit of connection is enough for me.

 >   *Don’t know much about history\
    Don’t know much biology\
    Don’t know much about a science book,\
    Don’t know much about the French I took\
    But I do know that I love you,\
    And I know that if you love me, too,\
    What a wonderful world this would be.\
