Personal Work
<h3>
From 2016 until 2021, I worked with clients who took an interest in automating their personal trading strategies, or rather, were interested in building a framework to mine for profitable trading strategies using a set of parameters. For these clients, I built tools using mostly Python and SQL to simulate a real trading environment, including order executions with broker specific trading costs and order typesâ€”including trailing stop loss orders. Backtesting frameworks were complete with summary analytics. Reporting included strategy profitability, drawdown risk, and other measures the client personally found useful in ranking strategies. Some of the major tasks in implementing a backtesting framework included: developing a mechanism for storing, retrieving, and regularly appending new candlestick pricing data as it became available; a second major task was accurately modeling market behaviors; a third aspect of these projects was developing analytics reports with useful ranking metrics; a fourth was optimizing the speed and processing usage to run 5-10 year backtests in large batches to hone in on profitable strategy parameters quickly; and finally, a fifth aspect was introducing trading strategies into a live context, using identical code as was used in our backtesting framework to ensure that the results found in our analytics reports matched as closely as possible (barring data discrepancies, which are unavoidable it seems) in the live context as they would in backtest, preserving the integrity of our backtesting framework.
