I am an writer, analyst, and philosopher focused on examining moral ecologies, primarily considering the philosophical grounds for developing a sense of natural value in order to bring ecological responsibility into the collective consciousness, as this shift will have a direct effect on the principles of design for a sustainable cultural and natural landscape for human beings.
<br><br>
Aside from philosophy, I have interests in investing and trading. I write to empower the individual investor, that they might sharpen their mindset with principles of risk and with awareness of the psychological difficulties that so often cause financial ruin to traders. While investing in profit-driven corporations may present a moral quandary, the principle of investing, as insurance against oneâ€™s individual economic risk, is applicable and beneficial for all who can participate. The barriers to entry have never been lower to retail investors than they are now.
