          In our second attempt to visit Muir Woods (the first hope dashed by an unknown parking reservation), Tarenne and I began our search for the biggest redwood we couldn't fit our hands around. The grove was not as big as I anticipated, and the path was heavily trafficked. This downed log seemed as good as any a candidate for a top left corner shot! The composition of this one leaves something to be desired, but I found that fitting nature in the foreground is more of a challenge than anticipated.">

          The drastic elevation change on the road to Kings Canyon gave Holland, Elly, and I quite the anxiety driving the Tesla into the remote areas of the park with limited range. And this - snapped moments before our first encounter with bears - struck me as an ephemeral moment of calm. The sounds of the meadow were overtaken by the wind, and puffs of seed packets of the native flora floated by like snow falls. We were surrounded by thousand foot cliff faces on three sides. I felt small. I had not been caught in a moment like this in quite some time. I was enraptured by the moment, truly.">

          Holland, Justin, and I took on the Devil's Garden Trail - approximately a 10 mile loop exploring more remote areas of the park - or more accurately, slightly out of reach of the typical tourist's hike. The juice was worth the squeeze. This picture was taken slightly before reaching the dark angel, which was an obvious spin off for the Brother's Three Quarterly.">

          Holland, Elly, and I took on the Yosemite Falls Trail, per my recommendation having described it as one of the most challenging yet rewarding hikes I had completed to date.  The falls had run dry long before, but the valley was as mesmerizing as I remembered. Numerous hawks and crows soaring overhead, the valley with a tinge of haze. At the top, we ate kettle-cooked bbq chips, peanuts, granola bars, and sour patch kids like maniacs. My tongue was numb from the sourness for a day and a half.">

          Jimmy is someone who, just by walking into a room, can warm you up and make you smile. What I admire most about 25 year old Jimbo though, is his growth. He was once a man known to carry a road beer (Or 2) in his back pocket. Just last weekend, I marveled as he pulled a philosophic novel by Sartre out of that same pocket for some on the go reading. He is the inspiration at times for me to
          continue on a learning path, and for that I am grateful.">

          Kevin is a mentor, and I’m not sure why he puts up with my annoying coding questions all the time. What I admire most is how he always makes himself available, always frees up time, and goes out of his way to be a resource when I have nothing to offer in return. Thanks Kev.">

          Andrew and Michelle- it is a rarity to find these two apart, but you do what you must for picture congruency. They are my inspiration to work hard when I don’t feel like working hard. What I admire most is their ambition to not only better themselves, but better the lives of others through their work. Also, their ability to create a jingle for any scenario. It’s a gift!">

          Tom is my dude and my guy, an A+ mate. He chills the hardest. He is also the funniest person I know. When he isn’t providing you with deep belly laughs, he is listening to you meander on about your day -really listening. And he cares. He is constantly considering the needs of others before his own. I don’t know how I would’ve gotten by in Durham this long without him.">

          Zack is passionate about everything he does and has been that way since I’ve known him. He doesn’t shy away from a deep conversation. Nothing is sugar-coated. This is probably what I admire most about him: his drive, his entrepreneurial spirit to tackle any issue head on. One might call it.. a mamba mentality? Why yes, yes they would.">

          Holland is a creator, director, writer, producer, roommate, and old friend. The unique thing about old friends is how they can communicate without words, finish each other’s jokes before they’ve been made, and inspire each other’s growth. We’ve come a long way in Apt. 9, I think we just might make it after all. Cheers brother!">

          Vir is a pragmatist, and also (probably still) the fastest person I’ve ever seen. He is, to me, the embodiment of a team player. Beyond that, he is always looking to the needs of the group before his own. He’s an all-around great m8 that you NEED to know.">
