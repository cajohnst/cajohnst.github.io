<h4>Sitting On the Wing — <i>Inspired by Frank O’Hara</i></h4>

*Dec 24, 2016*

>Perhaps it is for some stroke of fantasy\
I carry my way over these fly-over states,\
It’s Christmas Eve, why haven’t I seen you?

>*Age never did mellow.*

>Sitting on the wing, I’m half in my imagination\
And half in reality, the way children are.\
My watch says it’s almost five, or is it eight?

>*I never did have a sense for time.*

>Little crystals form at the bottom of my window.\
We embark into a wall of cloud.\
I pick up my drink, and the wing flutters with turbulence.

>*How did I know to do that?*

>Misconstrued perceptions, what is the horizon at thirty-two thousand feet\
But more sky? Are the Rockies the tallest mountains?\
Does Phoenix own the sun? Maybe stained-glass windows were the first movies.

>*The world is an iceberg; so much is hidden just below!*

>The sun sets over west Texas and projects stories of us from beneath.\
The clouds appear a shade of gold I haven’t quite seen before,\
With hues of red along the ridges and puffs of blue among the fjords.

>*La vita è bella, in the moment.*

>You’re the queen of hearts and I’ll be the king of the air,\
Bound to travel over this impersonal vastness,\
The vault of heaven, it awaits our arrival, no?

>*But love never did look so good as when you looked my way.*

>And look! There’s Polaris, never so far-reaching.\
A view of the immaterial never so admonishing as the one above;\
Reminding of brevity, perspective, and cohabitation.

>*I am interesting, I am modern, I am a catastrophe.*

>To be as constant as a northern star, I feel nothing new,\
Only lesser versions of the past to singularity.\
But what is reality, don’t I have a right to be curious?

>*You were reality, and you’ve flown away.*

>Perhaps it was a flight much like this one, or maybe just a thought,\
You heard your captain speak to you as mine does now,\
“Thirty minutes to landing.” To board again or to go home, I don’t know.

>*Thoughts aren’t decisions, but thoughts can be warm. Merry Christmas.*
