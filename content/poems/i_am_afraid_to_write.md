<h4> I Am Afraid To Write - <i>Inspired by my inability to write.</i></h4>

*June 2021*

>I am afraid to write.\
I am afraid.

>I fear that collecting, organizing,\
And presenting my thoughts is too daunting.\
I fear exposing myself to criticism.\
I fear my own criticism.\
I fear that my voice will not be compelling.

>I worry about cadence.\
I worry about flow.\
I worry about word placement and tonality.\
I worry about the subjective reader.

>I fear being wrong.\
I fear being right!\
I fear making hard stances\
Which fail under broader systems of thought.\
I fear I have no business writing at all.\
Who granted me the authority?\
What school, institution, agency?

>*Might I tell myself that my opinion matters\
And believe it?\
Aren't we all competing in the economy of attention?*

>I fear that my prose will not compare to Proust (*it won't*)\
or my philosophy to that of Sartre (*it certainly won't!*).\
I fear that I will never play a part in dismantling any system\
(Or in reconstructing one)!\
I fear that nothing I say will hold relevance\
As timeless as passages from Thoreau, Baldwin, or Kafka.\
I fear that I will never make anything of writing.

>I worry about conveying ideas simply.\
I worry about omitting alternate points of view.\
I worry about organizational and structural points.\
I worry about stating something that has previously been\
Stated succinctly by someone else.

>I fear conflict.\
I fear resolution.\
I fear my experience and my inexperience.\
I *desperately* fear being drab.

>I am afraid to tell stories.\
I am afraid *not* to tell them.\
I am afraid for every reason imaginable.\
I am afraid for no good reason at all.
