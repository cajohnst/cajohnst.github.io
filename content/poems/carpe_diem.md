<h4> Carpe Diem - <i>Inspired by the Robert Frost poem of the same title.</i></h4>

*May 2013*

>Having perfected each facial feature\
She walked to the door and pulled back the drape\
To find, as was common procedure\
The sun giving way to a convex shape.

>She surged the dock, past reeds and leveled sand,\
To capture every prismatic color\
The sky offered before the sun remand,\
And inhaled the humid Savannah summer.

>Into darkness she awaited his return,\
Yet pillaged by clouds, the moon would not rise.\
This night, reflections she could not discern,\
And thoughts of two lives began to polarize.

>To live as she always had, or go north.\
The stars so numerous, but so removed\
Recede behind the drape of clouds come forth.\
Her present, like her future, remained unproved.

>Drops of rain began to fall and leaves\
Pirouetting with the blustering wind,\
Disturbed the placid Atlantic like thieves!\
The onslaught of ringlets would not rescind.

>She stood aghast, withholding for one query:\
Abide in the realized, coming, the now?\
What is past is past and cannot vary.\
The unknown, every justice will not allow.

>And the present:\
    *The present is too much for the senses,\
    Too crowding, too confusing-\
    Too present to imagine.*\
Unrequited would remain unrequited.\
And so, hoisting spirits amidst the storm,

>She arose, looking to pack as best she could,\
Assured she would not endure another day.\
Behind, the creek of weight on rotted wood,\
A sonorous voice met her ears, *“stay”*.
