# The Zoom Ice Breaker

***A scheme as thoughtfully implemented by Laurence from sales - put to pen and paper by Carter A Johnston. New Orleans, LA via Chicago, IL - Late April 2021***

The quaintest lies are those that admit themselves into the realm of the absurd, far exceeding the listener's sense of normalcy as to throw off their internal truth evaluating system. In short, having the audacity makes the lie.

It was with this in mind that Laurence sat down to his new company's Zoom happy hour call, joining team members from across the country with a casual 5.5% ABV IPA in hand. He leaned back confidently in his chair, nearly to the tipping point. The chair creeked a little and he cleared his throat before adjusting back to a normal posture. Most who joined the call had gotten to know Laurence slightly at this point through brief interactions on Slack or email. Laurence greeted Rachel, whom he had been good friends with prior to joining up with the company, in the side chat bar. Rachel had connected him with the recruiting manager and thus had secured him the position. After a brief round robin of "getting to know you" style questions, it came time for Laurence to disclose his coveted "most interesting fact" about himself to all those joined on the video conference.

For most, this is a moment of high anxiety. The mind floods with endless simulations of scenarios in which personal interests are labeled *"not safe!"* or *"forgettable!"* and the narrating, risk-averse self typically leans toward the latter. First impressions define relationships after all!

But Laurence is not like this. Laurence knows a little white lie will spark *just* the right amount of intrigue. Laurence smiles wistfully, then discloses that he is six feet and ten inches tall - to gasps then silence from his captive audience. The evidence for such a claim ought to be obvious. He is on camera, in plain sight to all, and yet... it isn't entirely refutable. He and Rachel are in Chicago, the rest of the group are in New York, Seattle, Austin. Laurence had never been to company headquarters and was even hired over Zoom! So who can verify this tidbit? Rachel of course. His good friend Rachel. Without a beat missed, Rachel cooly confirms the claim.

The follow up questions are predictable: "You must have had basketball aspirations?" - to which he replies "naturally, but my jump hook wasn't quite what scouts were looking for". Most other questions are lazily brushed aside, as if Laurence has nothing to prove. And he doesn't. "What's your shoe size?" - "13, feet run small in my family". The berating continues: "Ok, not that I don't trust you, but would you stand in your doorway?" Laurence dignifies this with an eye roll and a sigh, then a breathy chuckle as if standing up were a chore, but he complies nonetheless. Laurence's head does indeed come close to the top of the doorframe, to which he exlaims "12 foot ceilings. One of ten complexes in Manhattan, my realtor had a field day when she found it." Having guilelessly survived the onslaught of interrogative questioning, and after a brief puase, Lindsey, the Zoom host, regathered attentions to focus on the next poor soul whose attempt to seem interesting or modern would ultimately be catastrophic following Laurence's Goliath sized claim.

The lie now cemented into truth, or at least into company lore, Laurence's presence commanded attention. From then on, his opinions were rarely contested. Laurence was *never* interrupted in a meeting and his opinions were met with the utmost respect. In the end, it did not matter whether Laurence was *actually* six feet and ten inches tall. Of consequence was his utter lack of cowardice in claiming it.

And how long can this sort of gag be kept up? To the tune of at least one pandemic, possibly indefinitely. Such is digital life. Is this the best lie ever told? The argument for is strong.

### How to be like Laurence in a few short steps:

**Step 1:**
Begin work at a new job amidst or after a global pandemic, whereafter remote work is necessary or at least mostly accepted.  Preference here leans toward a company in which most or all employees have never met you in person.

>*Addendum: Make sure that interviews are conducted on Zoom and your camera is set such that nothing below the shoulder is revealed.*

**Step 2:**
Conduct a somewhat thorough investigation of your social media presence. *REMOVE* photos that might reveal your bodily proportions. *KEEP* photos in which you are posing next to your shorter friends. Experiments with depth of field posing are encouraged proportional to your dedication to the cause.

**Step 3:**
If no pre-existing relationship exists between you and a co-worker, invest hard and quick in a friendship with the person who is seemingly the most rogue among colleagues. This person will be instrumental in corroborating your story.

**Step 4:**
Watch yourself answer potential ice breaker questions in the mirror. Observe, repeat, improve until you are comfortable telling yourself your story. If this seems abnormal or neurotic, it's because it is. No shame in that. This is an acting performance, the world is your stage after all.

**Step 5:**
Execute.

**Step 6:**
Profit from your commanding spirit and respectability acquisitions which will inevitably lead to great career success as leadership qualities have been thrust upon you.


> As You Like It, Act II, Scene VII

>*All the world's a stage,*\
And all the men and women merely players;\
They have their exits and their entrances,\
And one man in his time plays many parts,\
His acts being eight ages. At first, the infant,\
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel\
And shining morning face, creeping like snail\
Unwillingly to school. Then he grows and grows, and\
His self-stature expands to six feet and ten inches.\
He is audacious, cracking Zoom ice breakers with pointed\
Wit and charm. He becomes the lover,\
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,\
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,\
Seeking the bubble reputation\
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\
In fair round belly with good capon lined,\
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\
Full of wise saws and modern instances;\
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,\
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;\
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide\
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,\
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes\
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\
That ends this strange eventful history,\
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,\
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
