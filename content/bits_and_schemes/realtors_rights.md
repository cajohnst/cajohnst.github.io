# Realtor's Rights

>*A scheme, as thoughtfully developed by Carter A Johnston and Holland Randolph Gallagher while observing a realtor guide two clients into an adjacent for-sale apartment. New Orleans, LA - Early April 2021*

It is no secret, among the millenial types at least, that New York City rent could not be paid for by the prettiest of all pennies these days.  For the realtor, this is both good and great news- good because matching a landlord to a tenant can net a handsome fee, great because, as a realtor, you now have access to the city's best least sellable apartments... rent free.

Here is how it might go down:

**Step 1:** Collect a real estate license.

**Step 2:** Gain reputation points among a few realtors with relatively major clout.

**Step 3:** Generate up a list of solid, unsellable properties with the least nosy neighbors using leads from your new realtor friends.

**Step 4:** Convince, or rather pre-select, clients to stage their apartment with move-in ready furnishings.

**Step 5:** Client moves out of apartment due to their current obligations (i.e new job, new family, old job, old family (yikes!))

**Step 6:** Take up residence in the unsellable apartment. Advise client against lowering the price because market conditions are favorable ;).

**Step 7:** Enjoy the fruits of your labor, a free living situation for one to two months! Or if you can make it to six... invoke squatter's rights?

**Step 8:** Leverage the fuck out of your saved earnings that would have been dumped into an apartment of your own. Invest in yourself- acting classes perhaps, or maybe order that newly minted NFT you've been lucidly dreaming about? Lock it up in the Cayman's?

**Step 9:** Rinse, repeat.

> *It's New York, baby and life's a dream in the city that never sleeps! Take what you must and profit where you can, we are realtors and we will get the job done (when the job is sleeping in your bed like Goldilocks).*
