<i>The Buck Starts Here: Investing, for Everyone</i> is a book I am writing for a new trader or investor who is looking for ways to build individual wealth responsibly. The chapters are a reflection of areas in my educational journey as both an investor and trader which I felt were underemphasized, or which I selectively dismissed because I was caught up in the excitement of a gamble (see cryptocurrency). <i>The Buck Starts Here</i> is an attempt to make persuasive, well-grounded arguments for why investing is for everyone.
<br><br>
The opening section is entitled <i>‘A Philosophy of Investing’</i> , which may be of some or of no interest at all to the reader. It is my attempt to ground the argument for investing to achieve financial independence, or at least retirement. Part II examines risk, and how deeply intertwined risk is with the decisions involved in investing and trading. It will include descriptions of the psychological maladies which lead many investors and traders into making poor decisions. It will offer tools in the form of rules-based strategies, concluding with the two great statistically-based strategies, value investing and index investing (confidence testing and averaging by other names), which offer the investor active and passive approaches to investing. Part III is more traditionally informative. It includes chapters on markets, emergency funds, information on economic data for analysis, and the Federal Reserve system. Chapters on tax considerations, retirement vehicles, and asset classes are even less opinionated, but deserve recognition, as I have had to personally educate myself on these topics as situations arose. It is difficult to write on these topics briefly, however, because the rules tend to be very particular to the investor or trader’s situation.
<br><br>
 Ultimately, I think my goal for this book is to write the guide to trading and investing that my past self would find persuasive and constructive. My past disregard for risk is reflected in its emphasis here. <i>The Buck Starts Here</i> is an attempt to establish the framework that would motivate me to continue my pursuit of financial independence. When I exited software development to become a full-time trader, I believed I had achieved my version of financial independence, but that decision was made rashly because it was made without regard for the volatility of my investment choices. To me, investing is the act of removing personal economic risk. I hope I can present a convincing argument for that to the reader.
