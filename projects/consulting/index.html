The problems I want to engage with are 21<sup>st</sup> century problems: shrinking ecosystems, increased stress on the social fabric, and a looming, debt-fueled economic crisis, to name but a few. My most valuable skill set is systems framing, analysis, and general problem solving. I consider myself to think and communicate well. I come from a data science background—I retain proficiency in Python and SQL, however, I am not interested in roles where I would put this proficiency to primary use.
<br>
<br>
On one front, I am looking to engage with individuals who are searching for assistance in developing risk-minded investment strategies.
<br>
<br>
On a second front, I wish to engage with non-profits, think tanks, or similar organizations who are working toward preserving ecosystems; increasing connectivity within social frameworks; that serve to cultivate the individual mind to think and act for itself; or are actively preparing solutions for tomorrow’s economic realities.
<br>
<br>
I accept short-term and intermediate-term projects that I believe align with my values. I live in New York City, but am open to working in a remote setting. If you believe your project meets these criteria, please reach out as I would love to connect to see if we are a viable fit to work together.
