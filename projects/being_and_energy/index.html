An homage to Sartre’s <i>Being and Nothingness</i> (and, by inheritance, Heidegger’s <i>Being and Time</i>), <i>Being and Energy</i> is first an attempt to propose a radical system of <i>‘relations’</i> that is the composition of <i>all that there is</i>. We call this system the Universe. In contrast, we have the Atom, the fundamental unit in the Universe (and in all realities). The Atom is the node with respect to our graphical representation of the Universe. The nature of the Universe is such that there is behavior, which is to say, there is energy. Atoms display tendencies to associate and dissociate with others, and on a grand scale, the actions of Atoms are what we have called the laws of Nature. The tendency for atoms to modify their relation to each other, which is to say, display their energetic function, may be explained through presently undetectable connections. If such phenomena <i>were</i> to be detected, they would have a physical interpretation, or rather a geometrical one. We have defined our terms in a manner which denies the existence of the supernatural, not to insist on invalidating an ideological claim, but in a logical sense we believe nothing can <i>exist</i>, that is, display a boundary <i>relation</i>, outside of the Universe as we have defined it, <i>all that there is</i>.

One thing that is known, the Universe, at the extremes of quantum reality and cosmological reality, behaves in ways that are baffling to us living amidst <i>human</i> reality. From here forward, we define all relations between these two absolute pillars, the Atom and the Universe, the indivisible whole and the composite whole, for these are the ends within which knowledge must ground itself.

The objective of our metaphysics is to establish a clear logical framework where philosophy typically makes use of inconsistent, obscure language which can take a great deal of familiarity for the reader to entertain. We will do our best to take up the approach of Richard Feynman, replacing language with diagrams where possible. These metaphysics will argue that all realities, which we define as subsets of the Universal set, possess <i>uncertainty</i>.  Uncertainty is the set of all Universal relations that are excluded from the particular reality. Additionally, by defining a reality, or a <i>‘world’</i>, as we may refer to it,  as the conditional, modifiable subset of the Universal set, we will assert the existence of unique, simultaneous realities—as many as are combinatorially possible among relations of Atoms.

In our metaphysics, any <i>thing</i>, even the Atom itself, does not become material until it is related to another <i>thing</i>. The absolute ground for relation is a comparison of two <i>things</i>, one which may be considered the <i>focus</i>, the other its <i>background</i>. More complex relations are additive, a <i>thing</i> in comparison with another  <i>thing</i>, each with respect to a <i>background</i>, and so on. We call the 2-dimensional relation a <i>thing</i>. We call a relation of 3 or more dimensions a <i>system</i>. Relation is a determination, and therefore, no <i>thing</i> or <i>system</i> can be said to have absolute freedom. Rather, freedom is a useful measure of the amount of variation within or between relations. Where determination represents <i>certainty</i>, freedom is the inverse, <i>uncertainty</i>. As <i>things</i> become more complex, they become increasingly determined. This statement will become significant in our investigation of organic and inorganic being, our observation of chaotic, unpredictable behavior in the phenomena of quantum-scaled systems, and design-like, cohesive behavior in phenomena in human-scaled systems, up to cosmologically-scaled systems.

Atoms exhibit bonding, a physical relation where two or more atoms share or transfer electrons. When an atom bonds with another, it forgoes its individual freedom. Complex structures of Atoms bonded together are called molecules. Operating as a molecule, individual atoms remain unchanged relative to another, even as they modify their relation to atoms exterior to the molecule within a system. All else held constant, a newly minted molecular bond removes freedom from the system. Simultaneously, molecular structures of higher complexity are more likely to be bombarded by free energy and destroyed, which is to say, returned to a more fundamental state. Hence, complexity is limited but permitted. A system achieving its maximum potential complexity is extremely unlikely, and will always be the subject of bombardment from <i>uncertainty</i> entering the system. A closed system may develop toward an equilibrium state where the rate of complexity growth matches the rate of destruction. Of course, the only true closed system is the Universe itself.

Human beings readily categorize objects as <i>living</i> when these objects display an appearance of autonomy, which is to say, when they display a persistent structure and ability to harness energy for their own purposes. An organism’s movements are convincingly cohesive from a human perspective. Since the discoveries of Leeuwenhoek, one of the open investigations to petition biology, chemistry, and physics has been how to reconcile this cohesion of bodies, given that Life (and Nature) exists on a level beneath human sensory capacities, but might be ushered into human reality by the increased focal length of visually-enhancing lenses. The prevailing opinion for much of the time has been a simple one: life appears to be cohesive because it was designed. This theory is powerful, not because it is actually simple, but because it is readily cognizable. Design grants personhood to Life itself, or rather a supreme life, in fundamental conflict with Nature—chaos. Design is the assertion of order onto Nature. It is the body’s fulfillment of the mind’s imaginative assertions. It is the completion of activity. The human being understands design because design lies within all of their activity; design dictates the human being’s every movement. Design is ingrained in their ways of life.

In our metaphysics, Life is not fundamentally opposed to Nature. Rather, Life is a subset of Nature in the Universe. We find empirical evidence for this under the microscope. Magnification up to 10<sup>10</sup> meters (about 1 million times the maximum resolution of the human eye) reveals an astounding reality: not only are Nature and Life composed of Atoms, they are sourced from the <i>same set</i> of Atoms. This is a realization with profound implications. It means that human beings are not set apart from the Universe, rather, our <i>being</i> is the relations we have within it. We return to our quandary on the cohesiveness of bodies. How do living bodies exercise organized, <i>‘purposeful’</i> movement if there exists an underlying quantum reality in which <i>things</i> are grand compositions—persistent densities of fundamental particles each with its own individuality, each exacting its freedom in relation to the Universe? Again, <i>‘design’</i>, or rather divine will, seems a tempting explanation. It is most likely an inaccurate one, for it has been conditioned on an egocentric view of the Universe, as one might describe a book by referencing a letter on one of its pages. It is a lingering pre-Copernican attitude rearing its ugly head. We hope that our perspective is wide enough in the following pages to form a sentence.

We consider the following question: what qualities distinguish organic Life from inorganic Nature if Life is a subset of Nature? What <i>is</i> Life? Life is not simply a subset of higher natural complexity, for Nature is perfectly capable of arranging complex systems up to  cosmological scales: stars, galaxy formations, etc. It is equally, if not more capable of generating complex systems at the scale of human reality. Nature concentrates atoms by their structural capacities under situations of pressure and heat, for instance, within the mantle of the Earth. Once the heat contained in a system has decreased, or rather, the concentration of atoms is ejected from the mantle into a system of lower heat and lower pressure, a crystalline structure forms—a compact solid magnifying the symmetry that occurs when a single element dominates the quantum reality contained within it. Here, we turn to Schrödinger, who, in his essay <i>’What is Life’</i> conjectures that the fundamental structures of Life are <i>aperiodic</i> crystalline structures, which is to say, they are long chains of elements in an ‘irrationally’ ordered sequence. His observations predated the official discovery by Watson and Crick, but Schrödinger was essentially describing the nature and structure of DNA. Crystals are generated through their ability to orient the available elements in the surrounding system into rigid, symmetric patterns. Here, the relative strength of crystalline structure is a function of its chemical symmetry. In contrast, DNA exhibits no such rigidity. Its structure is permeable; it tolerates imperfections in its sequencing with minimal disruption: it is <i>adaptable</i>. It is also highly replicable. We believe DNA is able to accomplish all of this due to improbable <i>‘design’</i>, which initially occurred by happenstance, of the chemical machinery necessary to process the free energy of the surrounding system, achieving a level of tolerance for disorder that allowed Life to flourish against unceasing interaction with the Natural background. Life is a messy order of things, its strength lies not in its chemical symmetry, but in its ability to process flows of energy. It is a loophole in which Nature reflects itself. Life is its situation.
