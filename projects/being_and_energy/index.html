An homage to Sartre’s <em>Being and Nothingness</em> (and, by inheritance, Heidegger’s <em>Being and Time</em>), <em>Being and Energy</em> is first an attempt to propose a radical system of <em>‘relations’</em> that is the composition of <em>all that there is</em>. We call this system the Universe. In contrast, we have the Atom, the fundamental unit in the Universe (and in all realities). The Atom is the node with respect to our graphical representation of the Universe. The nature of the Universe is such that there is behavior, which is to say, there is energy. Atoms display tendencies to repulse or attract in the company of others, and on a grand scale, the actions of Atoms are what we have called the laws of Nature. The tendency for atoms to modify their relation to each other, which is to say, display their energetic function, may be explained through presently undetectable connections. If such phenomena <em>were</em> to be detected, they would have a physical interpretation, or rather a geometrical one. We have defined our terms in a manner which denies the existence of the supernatural, not that the ideological assertion cannot be made, but in a logical sense we believe nothing can <em>exist</em>, that is, possess a boundary <em>relation</em>, outside of the Universe as we have defined it, <em>all that there is</em>.
<br><br>
One thing that is known, the Universe, at the extremes of quantum reality and cosmological reality, behaves in ways that are baffling to us living amidst <em>human</em> reality. From here forward, we define all relations between these two pillars of the absolute, the Atom and the Universe, the indivisible and the whole, for these are the ends within which knowledge must ground itself.

The objective of our metaphysics is to establish a clear logical framework where philosophy typically makes use of inconsistent, obscure language which can take a great deal of familiarity for the reader to entertain. We will do our best to take up the approach of Richard Feynman, replacing language with diagrams where possible. These metaphysics will argue that all realities, which we define as subsets of the Universal set, possess <em>uncertainty</em>.  Uncertainty is the set of all Universal relations that are excluded from the particular reality. Additionally, by defining a reality, or a <em>‘world’</em>, as we may refer to it,  as the conditional, modifiable subset of the Universal set, we will assert the existence of unique, 'simultaneous' realities—as many as are combinatorially possible among relations of Atoms.
