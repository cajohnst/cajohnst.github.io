<h3> Abstract </h3>
<br>
Being and Energy is a collection of essays to be written in the phenomenological tradition.
<br>
<br>

<h3><i>The Metaphysics of a Relativistic, Uncertain World</i></h3>
The intent of this essay is to establish a metaphysics that aligns generally with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics in their current state. Metaphysical systems, whether consciously or not, have traditionally reflected—and served to reinforce—the prevailing theories in physics. It is perhaps inevitable that metaphysical conclusions would lag behind evidential physical discoveries, for while the physical world is the subject of all constraints of Nature, the metaphysical realm exists in the wholly elastic form of ideal structure, subject only to the constraints of the imagination.
