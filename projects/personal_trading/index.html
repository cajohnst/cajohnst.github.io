I am an active trader in foreign exchange markets. The forex markets have been of interest to me since I was able to open an account with a broker at 18. I think trading the currencies of the world was perhaps my way of feeling ‘international’. Still today, the macro interplays between global economies, the trends in central bank policy, international politics, are the stage set to keep me enthralled almost constantly. Market analysis is a puzzle that never quite puts itself together. My primary trading activity is based on volatility and trend analysis, and trades are more or less automatic, but I continue to perform the maintenance of recording my trades, and adjusting my risk framework based on my own judgment for implied volatility.
