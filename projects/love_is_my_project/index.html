<blockquote>
I am afraid to write. <br>
I am afraid.
<br>
<br>
I fear that collecting, organizing, <br>
And presenting my thoughts is too daunting. <br>
I fear exposing myself to criticism. <br>
I fear my own criticism. <br>
I fear that my voice will not be compelling.
<br>
<br>
I worry about cadence. <br>
I worry about flow. <br>
I worry about word placement and tonality. <br>
I worry about the subjective reader.
<br>
<br>
I fear being wrong. <br>
I fear being right! <br>
I fear making hard stances <br>
Which fail under broader systems of thought. <br>
I fear I have no business writing at all. <br>
Who granted me the authority? <br>
What school, institution, agency?
<br>
<br>
Might I tell myself that my opinion matters <br>
And believe it? <br>
Aren’t we all competing in the economy of attention?
<br>
<br>
I fear that my prose will not compare to Proust (it won’t) <br>
or my philosophy to that of Sartre (it won’t) <br>
I fear that I will never play a significant part in dismantling any system <br>
(or in reconstructing one) <br>
I fear that nothing I say will hold relevance <br>
as passages from Thoreau, Baldwin, or Kafka do. <br>
I fear that I will never make anything of writing.
<br>
<br>
I worry about conveying ideas simply. <br>
I worry about omitting alternate points of view. <br>
I worry about organizational and structural points. <br>
I worry about stating something that has previously been <br>
stated succinctly by someone else.
<br>
<br>
I fear conflict. <br>
I fear resolution. <br>
I fear my experience and my inexperience. <br>
I desperately fear being drab.
<br>
<br>
I am afraid to tell stories. <br>
I am afraid not to tell them. <br>
I am afraid for every reason imaginable. <br>
I am afraid for no good reason at all.

    In June of 2021, I was sitting alone at a bench in New Orleans’ Audubon Park. The shade from the nearby oak tree, possessing aesthetic completion with its complementary Spanish moss, had shifted to my right, and the sun was unforgiving. I had placed myself at this bench in the hopes of absorbing some of the serene offerings of the park, that they might lead me beyond my writer’s block. Instead, I found myself squinting into my laptop screen at its maximum brightness, hands placed on my furrowed brow line for shade, with beads of sweat accumulating on my scalp. At the time I was feeling the rumblings of a story needing to be told, my story, and I was determined not to let these physical elements deter me from conjuring the words. The desire for the words to commit themselves to the page had become overbearing. What I felt was the totality of the words’ emotions, but I was unable to give them voice. My ‘story’ had no narrative, it was only events and patterns which had been bulwarked by intense emotion. I went to New Orleans because I had become immobilized attempting to solve this puzzle. I had quit my job three months earlier in order to take the words to task. I would be a writer, and by mastering the words I would become a master of myself. When I could read my story back to myself, I would know who I had become, and by familiarizing myself with the character I was I would know how to advance my life forward. In my peripheral vision, I witnessed a man approaching my bench, negotiating confidently into a Motorola headset. His voice was booming and his laugh was rich. He engaged over the phone at the level of familiarity only the best salesman can achieve. I was curious enough to glance up as he passed a mere foot from me. The man before me had tucked his sweatpants into knee-high waders. He wore a colorful, tattered blanket draped under a cape of reflective material typically devoted to windshields. He began to rummage through the trash can a few feet from me, examining styrofoam to-go containers for their leftover contents. After making his selections, he sat at the bench with me—directly across from me—continuing his conversation over the phone as if completely unaware of my presence. He spread out his containers around my laptop, making considerable effort to prepare his meal with the proper condiments. He split packets of hot sauce over a relatively untouched bowl of red beans and rice, and packets of plum sauce over pickled cabbage. The air surrounding our bench became stale with the pungent smell of vinegar in summer heat. Suddenly, the man addressed me by offering a bit of his lunch. “I just ate”, I politely declined. He explained to me how he was, at that moment, in radio communication with his friends, who had recently been abducted by aliens. His name was Tom, and he would be joining his friends on their voyage in an alien spacecraft —on its way from the Andromeda galaxy—soon, presumably after lunch. Tom seemed genuinely happy, and his life appeared to have an intrepid sense of direction. He re-contextualized my struggle to define myself. As abruptly as he came, Tom gathered his containers, placing them back in the trash bin, on his way without a blip in his radio communications. I drafted out the words “I am afraid to write” on the blank page, and what began to flow was a poem, based out of the realization that writing, for me, had taken on all of the potency of unforeseen judgment. In comparison, my struggle to narrativize my life was a small concern. The lucid insight Tom provided, mainly that the best negation of concern was unconcern, became a rational scapegoat, allowing me to flee from the words for a while. More life experience would be necessary to resolve my narrative. But so as not to see myself as a coward, I would shift my activities into relentless preparation for my fateful engagement with the words, my personal Goliath. I was afraid to write, but I would not allow that to prevent me, when the time came, from taking proper aim with my sling. Following are the words, the late product of a heavily resisted shift in narrative arc, which came at a tantalizing trickle under the heading of <i>overcoming</i>, then a tranquil babbling under the heading of <i> forgiveness</i>. The words have allowed my story to set in a medium more permanent than concrete; they have given me the opportunity to reclaim my body and mind, and for that I am proud.

<h3> <i>A Second Conception </i></h3>
I graduated from the University of North Carolina in 2016. My majors were statistics & operations research and economics. I also minored in UNC's entrepreneurship program. I felt at the time, and would feel inclined to say today, that through some intentionality, but mostly by happenstance, I was able to reap the sows of liberal arts education—more than most anyway. The system offered me flexibility to satisfy a passion for literature. While I would scribble down discrete logical equations in the morning, after lunch, I would read, and reread the lines which heralded John Donne’s memento mori: <i>“no man is an island”</i>. I spent a semester assigned the task of reading Shakespeare’s plays, which I completed in the undergraduate library. When I did so, I would scan the room on occasion, anxious of catching a covetous glance: “look what I am getting away with!” I would say to myself, “if only they knew that I took pleasure in the readings, they would not allow this to be credited toward my GPA.” Underlying my gravitation toward literature, I believe, was a longing to craft my own story; it was an admiration for the power of wit to conjure up a romantic love through the pen. Ultimately, I believe, it was nostalgia for a reality I had never known. On alternating days, I exhausted my hand with figures of aggregate supply and demand curves—they were lines, as far as I remember—but my head had taken residence far above the clouds, I was in the stars. Perplexed by the idea of relativity, the boundlessness of the Universe, the births and deaths of stars, and the passing of time, my thoughts were fueled by lectures in astronomy. The professor did everyone the service of removing most of the physics from his course, which would have been more than prohibitive for me. As I recall he once said, “astronomy is not founded in equations, it is founded in wonder”, and I was wonder’s hopeless victim. I was spell-bound with binding together the relations of all things. Without any awareness of what I was doing, I had taken up the pastime of developing a small metaphysics. A project like this would absorb my thoughts, but better, it would safely detach me from my reality. Even then I was inwardly smug. The carrot of being realized by mankind dangled before me. Mankind was a faceless, grateful soul who would be there to accept my inevitable contribution to human thought—my solution to the metaphysical problems plaguing philosophy, my <i>‘theory of everything’</i>, I called it. I had plagiarized the name, as anyone familiar with the 2014 biopic on Stephen Hawking would recognize. Hawking’s <i>“A Brief History of Time”</i> had served as an addendum to my astronomical curriculum. I was an admirer of Stephen. He wrestled with the Universe’s most challenging concepts, and, on some level, we communed in the struggle of the body plaguing the mind. Stephen was a physicist concerned with unifying physics. I was a poet; I would find the underlying meaning that would unify <i>everything</i>. I do not mind so much that I made no attempt to disguise an egregious act of appropriation. I am wont to believe that cognitive dissonance and forgetfulness are the only original authors. For everyone else, creative projects are spawned out of a great inheritance.

I will attempt to weave together a narrative of my life beginning at this stage rather than chronologically, not because elements of my childhood are less relevant—they certainly are—but rather because this period marks the beginning of my independence, when I was able to think and live for myself. Before, I was not me. I was not me because there was no singular ‘I’. Before, I had multiple personas. One was for my school friends, another for my friends in the neighborhood. One was for the group I went to church with every Sunday, another for when I was home. A more charitable version of my home persona spawned once or twice a year when relatives came to visit. Finally, there was myself, my deepest self, which existed only for me. Like horcruxes, I had buried parts of this essential self in meaningful places, in memories I would revisit, in songs I told no one about, in little bits of poetry, in my ideas. Before, I undertook the project of making sure everyone in my life was shepherded within designated pens. I defined my relationships within place. I believed that as long as my flock was well fed, they would be unaware of their captivity. I would meet their occasional curiosity with a warm deflection or sarcastic diffusion, depending, of course, on my interlocutor’s compartment. In my past life, no one had shown me how to flourish. I had been used to living under a thick forest canopy, I had found my light between the shadows. In my second infancy I was a transplant. My development of the <i> ‘theory of everything’</i> was my attempt to unify the Universe, but underlying that was the gravitational pull to bring together a fractured ‘I’. It was my search for meaning, for the narrative that would put to good use all of my existing selves. What follows is the story of a decade-long struggle to define authentic living. It is my personal account of discovering truths within myself, on defining love, and finally, on becoming a whole being.

My undergraduate experience was all in good fun. I made sure to balance studying with a moderate drinking habit. Chapel Hill was a college town. The bar scene was the envy of the neighboring colleges. The time would be 1:48am and I would have a fresh Blue Cup—containing two pints of beer—in hand. My foot would catch on the nose of an unforgiving metal stair at He’s Not Here, and I would be caught by an acquaintance I had exchanged notes with in Econ 101 a few semesters back, greeted with an embrace and a warm hello. He’s Not was the stockyard for undergraduates, or anyone else who could be charmed by seven foot spackled ceilings and 1970’s beer advertisements, where the best stench one could hope for was of stale beer. The space was filled with no-nonsense wooden tables and chairs so haggard Hades must have been pleased by their wherewithal to cheat him. Still, a Blue Cup was five dollars, a steal even for the time. Needless to say, I loved He’s Not Here. My friends and I put more time into those seats than ones in lecture halls. We were randomly assigned to be roommates, the eight of us who began college together, yet the pervasive, unstated feeling among us was that we could not have chosen better for ourselves. It was a quasi-family affair. We ate together, we worked out together, we went out together. I was the runt of our circle. I was not the most athletic, nor the brightest; I was not good looking, nor particularly charismatic. I was the subject of much of the play-bullying because the jokes slid off of me like water. Whether anyone was aware or not, I cast myself into the role for our circle’s guardian of camaraderie. My instincts called for reliability and a listening ear. Friendship, for me, resonated best in the form of a true dialogue, but never in the company of more than two or three. Vulnerability was an occasion, it was the things you say when the protective layers of the psyche have been exposed by drunkenness, or exhaustion. Needless to say, I considered it my duty to manufacture these occasions when I could. We would return home from a night of drinking at He’s Not. I would pause as we were about to head inside. I would lean over our balcony. A particular shimmering star would catch my eye. I would comment: “isn’t it amazing how an object so bright can be hundreds or even thousands of light-years away…”, the edge of my top lip would curl into a grin, for on a level I did believe it, “all that light filling our eyes, an uninterrupted process.” Such a line would almost certainly elicit the desired outcome—a moment of contemplation in concrete abstraction, which is to say, the absurd. Peering into the ocean of the past, the onlooker is likely unaware that they are engaged in the absurd. Anyone who knows this knows they have a temporary window when their companion is fully engaged in wonder, where the ego is dazed, arrested in place, and can be bypassed. It is the opportune moment to pounce—before the greater consciousness resets with a grounding look at the feet supporting its endeavor. The spoils for winning such a game, at least for me (the one cognizant of playing it) was a spark of emotional intimacy, which, fingers crossed, would ignite a fully unarmored conversation, one in which truths are unquestionably valid because of the situation in which they are spoken. Even if a spark was generated, however, it was unlikely to catch, and the regrounded consciousness would turn itself toward more worldly affairs: a drunkenly crafted quesadilla that would need eating, a third rewatch of How I Met Your Mother that required attention. Of course, there were variations to the game. My friends and I would engage in the absurd (by which I mean meaningless) act of consuming late night reality TV shows. There was Steve Harvey’s Family Feud, which aired from 12am to 1am, then Jerry Springer’s Baggage from 1am to 2am every night on the Game Show Network. In truth, the underlying appeal to these shows was that watching them was a small act of rebellion, a waste of precious time. Here, my tactics were to seize upon my friends’ fatigue. For the tired friend, like his drunk companion, comes to a conversation with less armor.

I found it odd that no one I knew seemed as keen as I was to engage at the level of vulnerability that I sought to engage in. For me, vulnerability was the device used to reveal one's self in the other, which I believed was the highest achievement of any human relationship. My friends' interests—the latest rap and hip hop songs, the shapeliness of their incoming beards, efforts to build out their physique, discussing the cultural and political exposés of the time, testing the limits of their drinking, women, etc.—exuded raw adolescent energy. I liked these things too, and for moments I found myself completely immersed under their breaking crest. Then, I was happy, but I found myself unable to commit to them completely, as if the air in my lungs was beckoning me to remain at the surface, to swallow briny gulps of water as long as I could breathe a little soulful air. I was disappointed that my friends were not as inclined as I was to discover themselves through me as I was through them. For if they had been, they would surely have recognized the games I had fashioned and would have played along. My despondency first sharpened my ego, for it became evident that my heightened sense of empathy, which I rather believed to be genuine love and care, was extraordinary, particularly for a man. It would be a wellspring of life to anyone who encroached upon my shores. In its next phase, my despondency latched upon the romantic ideal—subjectivity, a soulmate, the <i>one</i>, my personal salvation. My hope required that I be a humanist, in order that humanity might procure for me the person who would show me who I was, or at least do the work of holding the mirror in my direction. I languished waiting for their manifestation, but I was familiar with the struggle of faith, I was brought up in it. I waited upon humanity in the same way I had once waited upon God, bound by the hands and feet with golden cords—patience and self-control. The sentences of my new holy scriptures had been crafted by Shakespeare and the romantic poets. I languished with these poets in their attempts to woo their beloved, to separate the beloved from their subjectivity, to consume it, and in their inevitable failure to do so. I rejoiced in their defiance, their denial of death, in their audacity to claim they had breathed life itself  into their words. I saw in their wit the opportunity to make whimsical that which was surely existential. And yet, I rejected romanticism’s enchantments, its mysticism. I craved the poet’s power, but denied myself that power on moral grounds—namely, because <i>true</i> love could not be exploitative. True love was not a conquest. It had no aggressor. True love gave of itself. True love completed its object. It did not beckon to be discovered, rather, it was found by those who were meant to find it. True love existed, to my great detriment, within <i>reason</i>. True love was absolute subjectivity, and try as I might have, I could not deprive this proposition of its facticity. My years of adolescent infancy were defined by cognitive dissonance. I existed in a practical world and prioritized practical studies so that I might lead a practical life. I made every effort to appear structurally sound, to reject my past for the pleasures of experience, to be the mirror I sought. This was as much as I was capable of. My friends, the individuals I felt closest to in the world, would not know the difference. Internally, outside my formal academic setting, I was a vacuum of space with an insatiable appetite for truth, for stable values, for integration. This was the period of a long spell of grief, one after which I had bid my farewell to God.
