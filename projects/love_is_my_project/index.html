I graduated from the University of North Carolina in 2016. My majors were statistics & operations research and economics. I also minored in UNC's entrepreneurship program. I felt at the time, and would feel inclined to say today, that through some intentionality, but mostly by happenstance, I was able to reap the sows of liberal arts education—more than most anyway. The system offered me flexibility to satisfy a passion for literature. While I would scribble down discrete logical equations in the morning, after lunch, I would read, and reread the lines which heralded John Donne’s memento mori: <i>“no man is an island”</i>. I spent a semester assigned the task of reading Shakespeare’s plays, which I completed in the undergraduate library. When I did so, I would scan the room on occasion, anxious of catching a covetous glance: “look what I am getting away with!” I would say to myself, “if only they knew that I took pleasure in the readings, they would not allow this to be credited toward my GPA.” Underlying my gravitation toward literature, I believe, was a longing to craft my own story; it was an admiration of the power to conjure up a romantic love through the pen, on a whim. It was an attraction to the pleasure of wit. Ultimately, I believe, it was nostalgia for a reality I had never known. On alternating days, I exhausted my hand with figures of aggregate supply and demand curves—they were lines, as far as I remember—but my head had taken residence far above the clouds, I was in the stars. Perplexed by the idea of relativity, the boundlessness of the Universe, the births and deaths of stars, my thoughts were fueled by lectures in astronomy. The professor did everyone the service of removing most of the physics from his course, which would have been more than prohibitive for me. As I recall he once said, “astronomy is not founded in equations, it is founded in wonder”, and I was wonder’s hopeless victim. I was spell-bound with binding together the relations of all things. Without any awareness of what I was doing, I had taken up the project of developing a small metaphysics, but my inquiry was halted well before <i>‘understanding’</i> the cosmos. To understand would mean to find annihilation in generality, and I thoroughly rejected that repugnance. Rather, I found myself suspended near generality’s event horizon, content with (but oblivious to) the safety in battling my worthy adversary, my <i>‘high-level’</i> concepts of nature. My carrot was a notion of being realized by mankind: the faceless, kindhearted soul who would be grateful for my contribution to human thought. My stick was a long, painful path of malabsorption of life experience.

My undergraduate experience was all in good fun. I made sure to balance studying with a moderate drinking habit. Chapel Hill was a college town. The bar scene was the envy of neighboring colleges. The time would be 1:48am, a fresh Blue Cup would be in hand. One misstep up the unforgiving metal stairs of He’s Not Here would entail stumbling into the person you had exchanged notes with in Econ 101 a few semesters back. He’s Not was the stockyard for undergraduates, or anyone else who could be charmed by 7 foot spackled ceilings and 1970’s beer advertisements, where the best stench one could hope for was stale beer. The space was filled with no nonsense wooden tables and chairs so haggard Hades must have been pleased by their wherewithal to cheat him. Still, 2 pints of beer was 5 dollars, a steal even for the time. Needless to say, I loved He’s Not Here. My friends and I put more time into those seats than ones in lecture halls. We were randomly assigned to be roommates, the eight of us who began college together, yet the pervasive, unstated feeling among us was that we could not have chosen better for ourselves. It was a quasi-family affair. We ate together, we worked out together, we went out together. I was the runt of my circle of friends. I was not the most athletic, nor the brightest; I was not good looking, nor particularly charismatic. I was the subject of much of the play-bullying because the jokes slid off of me like water, and I did not contest. I cast myself for the role of guardian of camaraderie in our circle. My instinct for friendship was reliability and a listening ear. I found friendship resonated best for me in the form of a true dialogue, but never in the company of more than a few. Vulnerability was an occasion, it was, at the time, the things you say when the protective layers of the psyche have been exposed by drunkenness, or exhaustion. Needless to say, I considered it my duty to manufacture these occasions when I could. We would return home from a night of drinking on Franklin Street. I would pause as we were about to head inside. I would lean over the balcony. A particular star would be shimmering, it would catch my eye. I would comment: “isn’t it amazing how an object so bright can be hundreds or even thousands of light-years away…”, the edge of my top lip would curl into a grin, for on a level I did believe it, “all that light filling our eyes, an uninterrupted process.” Such a line would almost certainly elicit the desired outcome—a moment of contemplation in abstract realities, which is to say, the absurd. When one peers into the ocean of the past, they are likely unaware that they are engaged in the absurd. Anyone who knows this knows they have a temporary window when their companion is fully engaged in wonder, where the ego is drawn out into the act of connecting, where it is arrested in place, where it is <i>vulnerable</i>. It is the opportune moment to pounce, to hold the other’s ego within one’s palms before the attached consciousness resets with a grounding look at the feet supporting its endeavor. The spoils for winning such a game, at least for me (the one cognizant of playing it) was a spark of emotional intimacy, which, fingers crossed, might ignite a fully unarmored conversation, one in which truths are unquestionably valid because of the situation in which they were spoken. The spark, however, was unlikely to catch, and the regrounded consciousness would turn itself toward more worldly affairs: a drunkenly thrown together quesadilla that would need eating, a third rewatch of How I Met Your Mother that would need attention. Of course, there were variations to the game. We would engage in the absurd (which is to say, meaningless) act of consuming late night reality TV shows. There was Steve Harvey’s Family Feud, which aired from 12am to 1am, then Jerry Springer’s Baggage from 1am to 2am every night on the Game Show Network. In truth, the underlying appeal to these shows was that watching them was a small act of rebellion, a waste of precious time. Here, my tactics were to seize upon my friends’ fatigue. For the tired friend, like his drunk companion, comes to a conversation unarmored. I found it odd that no one I knew seemed as keen as I was to engage at the level of vulnerability that I sought to engage in. For me, the purpose of vulnerability was to reveal one's self to the other, which I believed was the highest achievement of any human relationship. My friends' interests—the latest rap and hip hop songs, the shapeliness of their incoming beards, efforts to build out their physique, discussing the cultural and political exposés of the time, testing the limits of their drinking, women, etc.—exuded raw adolescent energy. I liked these things too, and for moments I found myself completely immersed under their breaking crest. Then, I was happy, but I found myself unable to commit to them completely, as if the air in my lungs was beckoning me to remain at the surface, to swallow briny gulps of water as long as I could breathe a little soulful air. I was disappointed that my friends were not as inclined as I was to discover themselves through me as I was through them. For if they had been, they would surely have recognized the games I had fashioned and would have played along. My disappointment first fueled my ego, for it became evident that my emotional capacity for love and my internalized sense of care were extraordinary, particularly for a man. They would be a treasure for anyone who was willing to discover them. In its next phase, my disappointment channeled my path toward romanticism. My <i>hope</i> remained in humanity, that it might procure for me the person who would discover me for who I was. For that reason alone, I did not withdraw. The reality was perpetually disappointing, yet I remained a humanist. My <i>being</i> withdrew into the familiar, comforting arms of ideology—of fantasy and the languages of soul and of love. These adolescent years were defined by cognitive dissonance. I existed in a practical world and prioritized practical studies so that I might lead a practical life. All the while, I was preoccupied with raising a new essence, one on a different plane altogether. I was, <i>essentially</i>, structurally unsound, and devoted every moment I was alone to pouring anything concrete (or anything resembling concrete) into the foundation of this project. In retrospect, I can only describe this period as the beginning of a long spell of grief. One where I mourned the loss of my completion. One after I had bid my farewell to God.
