I graduated from the University of North Carolina in 2016. My majors were statistics & operations research and economics. I also minored in UNC's entrepreneurship program. I felt at the time, and would feel inclined to say today, that through some intentionality, but mostly by happenstance, I was able to reap the sows of liberal arts education—more than most anyway. The system offered me flexibility to satisfy a passion for literature. While I would scribble down discrete logical equations in the morning, after lunch, I would read, and reread the lines which heralded John Donne’s memento mori: <i>“no man is an island”</i>. I spent a semester assigned the task of reading Shakespeare’s plays, which I completed in the undergraduate library. When I did so, I would scan the room on occasion, anxious of catching a covetous glance: “look what I am getting away with!” I would say to myself, “if only they knew that I took pleasure in the readings, they would not allow this to be credited toward my GPA.” Underlying my gravitation toward literature, I believe, was a longing to craft my own story; it was an admiration of the power to conjure up a romantic love through the pen, on a whim. It was an attraction to the pleasures of wit. Ultimately, I believe, it was nostalgia for a reality I had never known. On alternating days, I exhausted my hand with figures of aggregate supply and demand curves—they were lines, as far as I remember—but my head had taken residence far above the clouds, I was in the stars. Perplexed by the idea of relativity, the boundlessness of the Universe, the births and deaths of stars, and the passing of time, my thoughts were fueled by lectures in astronomy. The professor did everyone the service of removing most of the physics from his course, which would have been more than prohibitive for me. As I recall he once said, “astronomy is not founded in equations, it is founded in wonder”, and I was wonder’s hopeless victim. I was spell-bound with binding together the relations of all things. Without any awareness of what I was doing, I had taken up the pastime of developing a small metaphysics. A project like this would absorb my thoughts, but better, it would safely detach me from my reality. Even then I was inwardly smug. The carrot of being realized by mankind dangled before me. Mankind was a faceless, grateful soul who would be there to accept my inevitable contribution to human thought—my solution to metaphysics, my <i>’theory of everything’</i>, I called it. I had plagiarized the name, as anyone familiar with the 2014 biopic on Stephen Hawking would recognize. Hawking’s <i>“A Brief History of Time”</i> had served as an addendum to my astronomical curriculum. I was an admirer of Stephen. He wrestled with the Universe’s most challenging concepts, and, on some level, we shared in the struggle of the body plaguing the mind. Stephen had wanted to unify all of physics. I wanted to unify <i>everything</i>. I do not mind so much that I made no attempt to disguise an egregious act of appropriation. I am wont to believe that cognitive dissonance and forgetfulness are the only original authors. For everyone else, creative projects are spawned out of a great inheritance. I begin my story at this stage of my life, not because elements of my childhood are irrelevant—they will become relevant—but rather because this period marks the beginning of my independence, when I began to think and live for myself. Before, I was not me. I was not me because there was no singular ‘I’. Before, I had multiple personas. One was for my school friends, another for my friends in the neighborhood. One was for the group I went to church with every Sunday, another for when I was home. A more charitable version of my home persona respawned one or two times a year when relatives came to visit. Finally, there was myself, my deepest self, which existed only for me. Like horcruxes, I had buried parts of this essential self in meaningful places, in memories I would revisit, in songs I told no one about, in little bits of poetry, in my ideas. Before, I undertook the project of making sure everyone in my life was shepherded within designated compartments. My relationships were defined by place and severe calculations of trust. I believed that as long as my flock was well fed, they would be unaware of their captivity. I would meet their occasional curiosity with a warm deflection or sarcastic diffusion, depending, of course, on my interlocutor’s compartment. In my past life, no one had shown me how to flourish. I had been used to living under a thick forest canopy. I had found my light between the shadows. In my second infancy, I was a transplant. My development of the <i> ‘theory of everything’</i> was my attempt to unify the Universe, but underlying that was the gravitational pull to bring together a fractured ‘I’. It was my search for meaning, for the narrative that would put to good use all of my existing selves. What follows is the story of a decade-long struggle to define authentic living. It is my personal account on finding love, on finding freedom in situation, on becoming a whole being.

My undergraduate experience was all in good fun. I made sure to balance studying with a moderate drinking habit. Chapel Hill was a college town. The bar scene was the envy of the neighboring colleges. The time would be 1:48am, I would have a fresh Blue Cup, 2 pints of beer, in hand. My foot would catch on the nose of the unforgiving metal stairs of He’s Not Here, and I would be caught stumbling by the person I had exchanged notes with in Econ 101 a few semesters back with a warm hello. He’s Not was the stockyard for undergraduates, or anyone else who could be charmed by 7 foot spackled ceilings and 1970’s beer advertisements, where the best stench one could hope for was stale beer. The space was filled with no nonsense wooden tables and chairs so haggard Hades must have been pleased by their wherewithal to cheat him. Still, a Blue Cup was 5 dollars, a steal even for the time. Needless to say, I loved He’s Not Here. My friends and I put more time into those seats than ones in lecture halls. We were randomly assigned to be roommates, the eight of us who began college together, yet the pervasive, unstated feeling among us was that we could not have chosen better for ourselves. It was a quasi-family affair. We ate together, we worked out together, we went out together. I was the runt of our circle. I was not the most athletic, nor the brightest; I was not good looking, nor particularly charismatic. I was the subject of much of the play-bullying, because the jokes slid off of me like water, and I did not contest. Whether anyone was aware or not, I cast myself for the role of our circle’s guardian of camaraderie. My instincts called for reliability and a listening ear. Friendship, for me, resonated best in the form of a true dialogue, but never in the company of more than a few. Vulnerability was an occasion, it was, at the time, the things you say when the protective layers of the psyche have been exposed by drunkenness, or exhaustion. Needless to say, I considered it my duty to manufacture these occasions when I could. We would return home from a night of drinking on Franklin Street. I would pause as we were about to head inside. I would lean over the balcony. A particular star would be shimmering, it would catch my eye. I would comment: “isn’t it amazing how an object so bright can be hundreds or even thousands of light-years away…”, the edge of my top lip would curl into a grin, for on a level I did believe it, “all that light filling our eyes, an uninterrupted process.” Such a line would almost certainly elicit the desired outcome—a moment of contemplation in abstract realities, which is to say, the absurd. When one peers into the ocean of the past, they are likely unaware that they are engaged in the absurd. Anyone who knows this knows they have a temporary window when their companion is fully engaged in wonder, where the ego is drawn out into the act of connecting, where it is arrested in place, where it is <i>vulnerable</i>. It is the opportune moment to pounce, to hold the other’s ego within one’s palms before the attached consciousness resets with a grounding look at the feet supporting its endeavor. The spoils for winning such a game, at least for me (the one cognizant of playing it) was a spark of emotional intimacy, which, fingers crossed, would ignite a fully unarmored conversation, one in which truths are unquestionably valid because of the situation in which they are spoken. Even if a spark was generated, however, it was unlikely to catch, and the regrounded consciousness would turn itself toward more worldly affairs: a drunkenly thrown together quesadilla that would need eating, a third rewatch of How I Met Your Mother that required attention. Of course, there were variations to the game. We would engage in the absurd (which is to say, meaningless) act of consuming late night reality TV shows. There was Steve Harvey’s Family Feud, which aired from 12am to 1am, then Jerry Springer’s Baggage from 1am to 2am every night on the Game Show Network. In truth, the underlying appeal to these shows was that watching them was a small act of rebellion, a waste of precious time. Here, my tactics were to seize upon my friends’ fatigue. For the tired friend, like his drunk companion, comes to a conversation unarmored. I found it odd that no one I knew seemed as keen as I was to engage at the level of vulnerability that I sought to engage in. For me, vulnerability was the device used to reveal one's self to the other, which I believed was the highest achievement of any human relationship. My friends' interests—the latest rap and hip hop songs, the shapeliness of their incoming beards, efforts to build out their physique, discussing the cultural and political exposés of the time, testing the limits of their drinking, women, etc.—exuded raw adolescent energy. I liked these things too, and for moments I found myself completely immersed under their breaking crest. Then, I was happy, but I found myself unable to commit to them completely, as if the air in my lungs was beckoning me to remain at the surface, to swallow briny gulps of water as long as I could breathe a little soulful air. I was disappointed that my friends were not as inclined as I was to discover themselves through me as I was through them. For if they had been, they would surely have recognized the games I had fashioned and would have played along. My despondency first sharpened my ego, for it became evident that my emotional capacity for empathy, which I rather believed to be genuine love and care, was extraordinary, particularly for a man. It would be a wellspring of life to anyone who encroached upon my shores. In its next phase, my despondency latched upon the romantic ideal—subjectivity, a soulmate, the one, <i>my personal salvation</i>. My hope required that I be a humanist, in order that humanity might procure for me the person who would show me who I was, or at least do the work of holding the mirror in my direction. I languished waiting for their manifestation, but I was familiar with the struggle of faith, I was brought up in it. I waited upon humanity in the same way I had once waited upon God, bound by the hands and feet with golden cords—patience and self-control. The sentences of my new holy scriptures had been crafted by Shakespeare and the romantic poets. I languished with these poets in their attempts to woo their beloved, to separate the beloved from their subjectivity, to consume it, and in their inevitable failure to do so. I rejoiced in their defiance, their denial of death. I saw in their wit the opportunity to make whimsical that which was surely existential. And yet, I rejected romanticism’s enchantments, its mysticism. I craved the poet’s power, then denied myself that power on moral grounds—namely, because <i>true</i> love could not be exploitative. True love was not an aggressor. True love gave of itself, completing its object. True love did not beckon to be discovered, rather, it was found by those who were meant to look for it. True love existed, to my great detriment, within <i>reason</i>. True love was absolute subjectivity, and try as I might have, I could not find it within myself to deny it. My years of adolescent infancy were defined by cognitive dissonance. I existed in a practical world and prioritized practical studies so that I might lead a practical life. I made every effort to appear structurally sound, to reject my past for the pleasures of experience, to be the mirror I sought. This was as much as I was capable of. All the while, within my formal academic setting, my essence was a vacuum of space with an insatiable appetite for truth, for stable values, for unification. This was the period of a long spell of grief, one after I had bid my farewell to God.
