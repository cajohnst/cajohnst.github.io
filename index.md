### What is a Chautauqua?
As I understand it, the chautauqua originated as a form of educational entertainment to the masses. A preacher, artist, educator, or troop might tour from town to town to share their stories in exchange for a place to stay and maybe a meal or two. On the circuit, they might expect to traverse a multitude of terrains from the lowest corner of the Mississippi to Oregon - the wild, unsettled West.  I can't help but imagine that, not only did these chautauquans give the road a bit of wear, to greater effect, the road must have given them some wear as well! I believe the chautauqua is a form of storytelling. Storytelling is how we make sense of the world, and how the world makes sense of us. *Through* it we leave our tracks in the desert and *by* it we get a bit of that rugged dirt between our toes which transfigures up our spine.

>Of course, I would be remiss if I did not reference Robert Pirsig's book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as providing my initial point of reference for the chautauqua. If you have not read this novel, I highly recommend reading it.

>The internet is the unsettled West of today.  It is the source of - for all intents and purposes - an infinite wealth of information (from an optimist's perspective). It is *also* the stage for frictionless, high-velocity collisions of ideas competing for crowded space in the collective mind (from the pessimist's perspective). It is structure and chaos confined within one system.

>We have made advancements in the transmission of ideas from speech to parchment to silicon. When culture and technology and society are being edited at such speed as they are today, it becomes difficult (for myself at least) to evaluate what is true and what is not. I need a calm, quiet respite to do that kind of mental work.

>So here it is. My digital chautauqua, a little slice of the internet - irrefutable evidence of my shaping stories and stories shaping me. Welcome! I hope to be expressionistic *and* intellectual here. I would like to share ideas that I think are of high quality - certainly not academic, or even scientific (although I will do my best to ensure my opinions are evidence-based) and to share my knowledge, creative pursuits, and life in an honest way.

Welcome again, and I hope you can take something meaningful home with you.
